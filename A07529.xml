            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Chriſtian Reader, though the carkaſse of Poperie,<note place="margin">Coſmog.</note> the better to auoide the heat of truth, ſit downe and ſhadowe it ſelfe, like the Sciopodes in <hi>Munſter,</hi> with one great legge of traditions: yet will it not be amiſſe, if I ſlit or cleaue that one great legge into two, namely, Traditions in generall, and the Romiſh primacie in particular, that it may stand vp the better to thy view, and ſo make a more open ſhew of it owne vglineſſe.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, I am not ignorant how eagerly the ancient Fathers bee vrged vpon vs, and how eaſily their authoritie may be auoided, as being no faſt friends to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie in this argument: yet, me thinkes, the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould heare the words of their owne Father, rather than any other father that euer put penne to paper, namely, they<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 16.29, 31.</note> haue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, let them heare them. And againe, if they heare not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, neither will they bee perſwaded though one riſe from the dead.</p>
            <p>What will the Papiſts, nay, what can they, or any man elſe liuing ſay to this? will they tell vs that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets be hard to vnderſtand, and that they containe not an abſolute and full doctrine of life and death, vnleſſe they be peeced out with traditions? I am ſure the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in hel durſt not ſay ſo much, &amp; yet it is to be preſumed that he would haue ſayd ſo, if he had not vnderſtood that it was not worth the propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in <hi>Abrahams</hi> preſence; thus much hee was bold to reply to the firſt part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpeech, nay, father <hi>Abraham,</hi> but if one come to my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, they wil ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their liues, but the ſecond
<pb facs="tcp:12995:5"/>
part which excluſiuely refers them to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, doth ſo ſtop his mouth, that hee had no whit further to plead for his owne brethren. It may be maruailed that he ſpake nothing, neither of the imperfection of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of Iewiſh traditions, nor any ſuch thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch apparitions from the dead; verily, if any ſuch plea had been of any moment, hee would not haue fayled to doe his best endeauour for his brethren, and to put <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in mind of the imperfection of his anſwere.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, that which he then durst not doe, is thinking it to be little worth, is now propounded and vrged by the Papiſts the Sonnes and heires of the rich Glutton, who euen in deſpight of <hi>Abraham,</hi> preſume to reply, that it is not inough to heare <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and that they will heare ſuch as riſe from the dead. Oh, take heede of ſuch deſperate fellowes as theſe be, that regard not the doctrine of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and make themſelues wiſer now in ſhifting off the force of his ſpeech, than Hell it ſelfe was in the dayes of our Sauiour, belike hell was not ſo wiſe then, as it is now, for now our Popiſh Gluttons can tell vs new tales of the darkenes, of the imperfectnes, of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie, of the corruptions of the Scripture, they can prate of traditions, and vnwritten verities which are not to bee found in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: howbeit, let him that hath any regard of his ſaluation conſider with himſelfe, whether is the ſurer and the ſafer way to beleeue them, or to beleeue <hi>Abraham,</hi> for it is impoſsible to beleeue both.</p>

               <hi>Stapleton</hi> goeth on ſtill, and beareth vs in hand againſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> that if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, were onely to bee heard, then the new Teſtament ſhould be excluded as ſuperfluous; but by Stapletons good leaue, thats neither ſo, nor ſo, for<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 18 15.</note>

               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they were the Ambaſsadors of Chriſt, and preached the word of reconciliation in Chriſts ſtead: if this yet ſtop
<pb facs="tcp:12995:6"/>
not <hi>Stapletons</hi> mouth, then let him know that the new Teſtament is not an addition, but an expoſition of the old, but ſuch an expoſition as all the world together could not haue made without the extraordinarie inſpiration of the ſpirite of Chriſt: and heere, for the full determination of this point, hearken (I pray thee) what their owne <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi> tels them in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon <hi>Luke, Habent</hi> Moſen <hi>qui docuit moralia &amp; agenda, habent prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas qui docuerunt myſtica &amp; credenda, &amp; iſta ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ad ſalutem, ideò ſequitur, audiant illos,</hi> They haue <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith hee) who hath taught morall things that ought to be done, they haue the Prophets, who haue taught myſticall things that ought to be beleeued, and theſe be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſaluation, therefore it followeth, heare them.</p>
            <p>Thus is the doctrine of inſufficiencie of the ſcripture, and neceſsitie of Traditions condemned to death, and muſt goe to the place of execution, vnleſſe a better pardon bee ſued out for it, than any that euer I could yet ſee regiſtred in their Popiſh Cronicles; howbeit, wee haue not yet done with this queſtion of traditions, for there is no man ſo careleſſe of his ſaluation, that will ſet vp an Altar to theſe vnknowne fictions, as<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17.23.</note> the Athenians did to the vnknowne God, before he know how many they bee, how few they be, what they be, and ſo conſider with himſelfe deliberately, whether they be fiſh, or fleſh, or good red her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; herein then we call vpon them for reſolution, and it is good reaſon wee ſhould ſo doe, till we know whether they dreame, or lye waking.</p>
            <p>This makes a ſort of them to vncaſe ſlouens, &amp; abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confeſse themſelues to be no better than heretickes,<note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 3. ca. 3. fund. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Canus</hi> a great Papiſt tels vs out of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12995:6"/>
that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not write the ſecrecies of the law, but deliuered them to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> by Tradition, and ſo infers, that the Apoſtles committed the ſecrecies of the Goſpel by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to a few wiſe and perfect men. And <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as great a Papiſt as liues this day,<note n="c" place="margin">Bellar. de verbo non ſcript. lib. 4 Cap. 8.</note> concludes out of <hi>Paul,</hi> that all thinges are not to be opened to all, but ſome things muſt be<note n="d" place="margin">1.

            <p>And here, to paſse ouer to the other point I promiſed
<pb facs="tcp:12995:7"/>
to ſpeake of, let it pleaſe thee to remember, who was the firſt founder of Traditions, namely, <hi>Papias</hi> a Chiliaſt, whom<note n="o" place="margin">Hiſt. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. lib. 2. 15. &amp; lib. 3. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> calleth, a publiſher of Paradoxes, and ſtrange and fabulous doctrines, an inconſiderate miſtaker of the diſputations of the Apoſtles, and a man of ſmall iudgement, yet this is the man that layd the firſt ſtone of <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo conſequently of the Papall Primacie, and where <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 5.13.</note> ſaith, the Church that is at <hi>Babylon</hi> ſaluteth you: this is the firſt that euer told vs that he means <hi>Rome,</hi> a worthy foundation, no doubt, to build religion vpon, and yet when he ſaith that [<hi>Rome</hi> is Babylon,] he puts vs all in minde to<note n="b" place="margin">Apo. 18.2.4.</note> come out of <hi>Rome,</hi> the habitation of Diuels, and the hold of all foule ſpirits, and a cage of euerie vncleane and hatefull bird.</p>
            <p>And here it is a world to ſee how the Papiſts labour to auoyd the force of this, and ſuch like Prophecies. This (ſay they) muſt bee meant of the heatheniſh, not of the Chriſtian <hi>Babylon.</hi> And I ſay againe, it neither must nor can be ſo meant, for who will yeeld, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould ſet downe that by way of Prophecie, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied alreadie by<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> long before either Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was baniſhed, or Christ was incarnate? Againe, if happily <hi>Daniel</hi> be otherwiſe vnderſtood, why ſhould the holy ghoſt ſpeake of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather than <hi>Corinth, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippos, Coloſſe, Theſſalonica,</hi> great Cities of <hi>Greece?</hi> or of <hi>Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, Laodicea,</hi> to which<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 1.4.</note> the Reuelation is dedicated? or the Citie of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where it is thought Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was Biſhop? were not all theſe Cities as heatheniſh as <hi>Rome,</hi> and better knowne to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſo to be, than <hi>Rome</hi> was? What? was Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> made a Prophet to
<pb facs="tcp:12995:8"/>
ſpeake against heatheniſh <hi>Rome</hi> which he neuer ſaw, nor came neere to, and no prophet at all to ſpeake of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſhnes of ſo many Cities that hee had ſeen ſo often, and was ſo well acquainted withall? Moreouer, if this might be yeelded vnto, yet why ſhould heatheniſh <hi>Rome</hi> be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the perſon of a gawdie ſcarlet coloured whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and be counted the mother of all the filthineſse, whoredomes, and abhominations of the earth: whereas indeed there was neuer a more manly, and more continent gouernement in the world?</p>
            <p>In the<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi> the chiefe Kingdomes and Empires of the earth, are deſcribed vnto vs by the names of Lions, &amp; Beares, and Leopards, and ſtronge, terrible, and fearfull beaſts with yron teeth &amp; nayles of braſse; and ſhall we thinke that the most continent, moſt iuſt, moſt ſtrong, moſt terrible, and couragious gouernment that euer was in the world, ſhould be compared by the holy ghoſt to a fine daintie Dame, to a tender nice whore, to a proud ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe whore, that made open ſhew of the filthineſse of her Fornication? No, no, this verie Booke of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Reuelation<note n="f" place="margin">Apoc, 13, 2.</note> doth compare the Romane Emperor to a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard with Beares feet, and a Lions mouth, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelues doe ſo vnderſtand it.</p>
            <p>And here obſerue, that beſide the firſt beast which was like a Leopard, there is another there ſpoken of, which hauing two hornes like a lambe, ſpake like a Dragon, and did all the first beast could doe, and more too, euen in his ſight and preſence. Now, what can this ſecond beaſt be, but the [Lambe skinned] &amp; [Dragon tongued] Prelacy of <hi>Rome?</hi> and what other beast did the Romane Empire euer yeeld vnto, but this onely? whereof it followeth, that
<pb facs="tcp:12995:8"/>
the first beaſt is not onely the heatheniſh Emperours, but the ſucceſsion in generalitie, for the heatheniſh neuer yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any of their heads to be cured by the Romiſh Dragon; nay marke further where the<note n="g" place="margin">Apoc. cap. 18.</note> holy Ghoſt teacheth, that this firſt beast that hath ſeuen heads and ten hornes, is rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the ſcarlet coloured whore of <hi>Baylon,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderſtood ſingly of the heatheniſh Emperours, but generally of the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> which at length yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his backe to bee ſadled and ridden by that Babyloniſh Harlot, which<note n="h" place="margin">Cap. 19.20.</note> is afterward called a falſe prophet.

                  <head>The Anſwere.</head>
                  <p>IT is a common ſaying, that ſuch as doe <hi>deficere in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo actu,</hi> faile in the laſt act, are fooliſh Poets; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be fooliſh Diuines, or no, that faile euerie where beginning and ending and all, iudge you; and that you may doe it the better, obſerue I pray you, how vntowardly this popiſh Diuine begins to lay his foundation, that you may the better iudge of the whole frame of his building. The word [Catholicke] is taken three maner of wayes; firſt, for that which is oppoſed to heretical or ſchiſmaticall, as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia Catholica,</hi> the Catholicke Church, and <hi>Eccleſia Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> the Church of the Martyrs,<note place="margin">Haereſi. 68.</note> in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Secondly, for that which is oppoſed to the Church of the Iewes, for ſuch a ſignification hath the word [Catholicke] in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Epiſtle. Laſtly, for the generall fellowſhip of all the children of God elected and adopted in Chriſt Ieſu before the foundations of the world: for none elſe can bee the members of the bodie of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.23. &amp; Coloſ. 1.24.</note> and in this ſignification it is taken in our Creed.</p>
                  <p>Now it would be knowne, which of theſe ſignifications is meant in the firſt queſtion, the firſt ſignification reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the word [Catholicke] to particular Churches, &amp; it is not like that your Papiſt demaundeth, whether you beleeue this or that Church in particular. Againe, the ſecond op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12995:10"/>
the word [Catholicke] to the church of <hi>Iurie,</hi> wheras your Papiſt includeth the church of <hi>Iurie,</hi> before there was any other church any where planted: in his queſtion, ſaying <hi>Doe you beléeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholique Church, planted firſt by the Apoſtles in</hi> Iudaea, <hi>and afterward diſperſed &amp;c.</hi> The laſt ſignification is applied to the Saints of God predeſtinated to ſaluation,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19</note> which Church was neuer planted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but by the eternall decree of God who onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his.</p>
                  <p>Againe, I can hardly brooke that the Church is here ſaid to be firſt planted by the Apoſtles, for God had his Church euer from the beginning; or that it hath remained euer ſince the Apoſtles planted it, for it hath remained euer from the beginning: now if it be ſayd, that hee meaneth the Church vnder the Goſpell;<note place="margin">Rom. 15.8. Heb. 2.3.</note> it will trouble him to prooue that the Apoſtles were the firſt planters of that Church in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe was miniſter of the circumciſion, and firſt began to preach ſaluation before it was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them that heard him.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, that the Church was euer diſperſed through the whole world by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles, is ſooner ſaid than prooued; for though <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that the fall of the Iewes was the riches of the world, yet doth hee not meane the whole world ſimply without exception, no more than Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth when he ſaith that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> decreed that all the world ſhould bee taxed;<note place="margin">Luk. 2.1. Math. 28.19. Luk. 24.47. Mark. 16.15. Act. 16.6. &amp;c. 2.

                  <p>Laſtly, it would bee agreed vpon, what faith or beleefe your Papiſt meaneth, when hee ſaith, <hi>Doe you beléeue the catholicke Church, whether iuſtifying or hiſtoricall?</hi> For though he ſeeme to fetch his queſtion out of the Creed, wherein the articles of iuſtifying faith are recorded, and ſo to make the catholicke Church inuiſible, for faith is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12995:11"/>
the euidence of thinges not ſeene:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> yet when hee addeth planted by the Apoſtles in <hi>Iudaea</hi> &amp;c. he maketh it viſible, and ſo not to be beleeued. Wherefore though this firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion haue neither head nor foot; yet thus in charitie I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of it, that it demaundeth, whether we beleeue hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically that there were orderly Churches or companies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing catholicke doctrine taught by the Apoſtles firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, and then among the Gentiles, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and profeſſors ſhall continue in one place or other to the worlds end; if this be the queſtion, then haue you anſwered catholiquely, firſt that you beleeue this, and then ſecondly that the Proteſtants onely are the viſible and knowne members of Gods church. Now where it is demaunded in the third and fourth place how wee knowe this, whether by outward meanes, or by inſpiration: it is anſwered, that the canonicall word of God doth ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, and better witneſſe than this we deſire none; and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this word of God, the Papiſts graunt all thoſe bookes to bee canonicall, which wee call canonicall, though they adde other Bookes which wee admit not for grounds and foundations of faith: but if wee cannot make good our profeſſion by thoſe bookes which both ſides agree vpon, and by the ſame bookes ouerthrow all that the Papiſts hold againſt vs at this day; then I for my part, will ſoone yeeld to the Pope, and craue abſolution vpon my knees.</p>
                  <p>Nowe forſooth the diſcerning of theſe canonicall Scriptures is called into queſtion, and they muſt bee ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the infirmity of man: howbeit your anſwere, though it be true, yet is it inſufficient; for howſoeuer, the vniforme conſent of antiquitie is not to be neglected: yet as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.36.</note> that he had greater witneſſe than the witneſſe of <hi>Iohn;</hi> ſo hath the holy Scripture greater witneſſe than the witneſſe of the Fathers, namely, the puritie and incontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led antiquitie of it, the Maieſtie of the ſtile, the conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the precepts thereof to the lawe of nature, and diuers other outward meanes noted by Maſter <hi>Caluine</hi> in his Inſtitutions;<note place="margin">Lib. 1.

Chapter of Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>1. Epiſtle to the Corinths, it appeareth that Saint</hi> Paul <hi>did ordaine in all the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>that collection ſhould be made for the poore, vpon the firſt day of the weeke, where hee doth alſo exhort the Corinthians to doe the like vpon the ſame day: whereby it is euident that the Sunday was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles to be the Chriſtians Sabbath, which is nothing elſe but a day of reſt from labour, and a day to bee beſtowed in hearing the word preached, breaking of bread, whereby is meant adminiſtration of the Sacrament, giuing of almes, and other workes of deuotion and pietie: for proofe whereof, out of the places aboue alleaged, I doe draw this argument againſt you: That day wherein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did ordaine, that Chriſtians ſhould weekely meete together to exerciſe themſelues in hearing the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, receiuing the Sacrament, and giuing of Almes: that ſame day did the Apoſtles ordain to be the Sabbath of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but the Apoſtle did ordaine that Chriſtians ſhould weekly aſſemble themſelues vpon the firſt day of the weeke for the purpoſes before mentioned: therefore the Apoſtle did ordaine the firſt day of the weeke to be the Chriſtians Sabbath.

                  </hi> I denie the <hi>Maior,</hi> for (that being graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) if the Apoſtles did appoint moe daies in a wéeke than one for Chriſtians to aſſemble themſelues for the like Chriſtian exerciſes, by the ſame argument you<note n="a" place="margin">Non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

common,<note n="b" place="margin">That is not their intent. <hi>Act. 2.45.</hi>
                  </note> to the intent that they might be wholy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſeruice of God, had moe dayes than one in a wéeke appointed for that purpoſe.

Let vs<note n="c" place="margin">Admit what you will, yet the firſt of the weeke is the ordinarie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day.</note> admit that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was to depart on the Tueſday, and that the Chriſtians were aſſembled on the Monday to breake bread, and to heare <hi>Paul</hi> preach before his departure, might not I in this caſe, make as ſtronge an argument, to prooue Monday to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians Sabbath, as yours is for the Sunday? In the <hi>16.</hi> Chapter of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> 1. Epiſtle vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinths, the Apoſtle doth preſcribe the firſt day of the wéeke vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinths, as a day whereon they ought to lay aſide for the poore as their deuotion ſhall ſerue; it is not preaching, prayer, or adminiſtration of Sacraments, that is in this place enioyned, but it is a laying aſide for the poore. Why doth the Apoſtle enioyne this contribution for the poore to be made at that time? the anſwere followeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text, That there be no gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings when I come: Why would the Apoſtle haue no gatherings when he came? no doubt becauſe hée would not haue ſuch ſpirituall exerciſes, as he determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow amonge them at his returne vnto them<note n="d" place="margin">Then this day was not onely for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, but for ſpirituall exerciſes.</note>, hindered or impeached by ſuch collections: if this were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaning of the Apoſtle, then is it not like that he would appoint the Sabbath for the making of ſuch collections, which is wholy<note n="e" place="margin">Not wholy, ſo as no time ſhould be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> to be employed in ſuch ſpirituall exerciſes as hée meant to vſe amonge them at his returne, and therefore this place would better ſerue a wrangler to prooue that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12995:13"/>
the firſt day of the wéek was not appointed to be the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Sabbath, then it will ſerue you to the contrarie. <hi>Pro. <hi>Out of this place it may be gathered that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, vpon the firſt day of the weeke, did weekely aſſemble together, for there is no time ſo fit for collections, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſemblies; and a weekely aſſembly vpon that day doth manifeſtly proue it to be the Sabbath. Pap.</hi>
                  </hi> You can wring no generall aſſemblies out of that place, for the text ſaith, Let euerie one put apart by himſelfe, and lay vp, which argueth rather<note n="f" place="margin">Neither doe we imagine, that all ſaw what euerie man gaue, or tooke it from him, but he himſelfe layd it vp, as the reſt did, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon purſe; elſe Paul muſt either gather it, or tarry the gathering of it, when hee came.</note> a priuate laying vp at home, than a contribution in an aſſembly, as your marginall note in the Engliſh Bible interpreteth: for how can a man bée ſayd to lay vp that which he doth deliuer to another in ſuch a contribution? <hi>Pro. <hi>It appeareth in the firſt of the Reuelation, that in Saint</hi> Iohns <hi>time, the firſt day of the weeke was called the Lords day, which is as much as if hee had called it the Chriſtians Sabbath. Pap.</hi>
                  </hi> You ſhall find in that Chapter, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was in the ſpirit on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords day, whereupon you may conclude, that in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time one day of the wéeke was called the Lords day, which we doe graunt; and more than that, that the firſt day of the wéeke was then called the Lords day, (which would haue put you to your ſhifts to haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the word) yet haue you gained nothing: for what conſequent is this, the firſt day of the wéeke was of the Apoſtles called the Lords day, therefore the Iewes Sabbath is to be aboliſhed, and the firſt day of the wéeke is to be obſerued for the Sabbath of Chriſtians? might not the firſt day of the wéeke be called the Lords day in regard of Chriſts reſurrection, and yet the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath remaine, or be aboliſhed, as other of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were, without ſubſtituting another Sabbath in place thereof? Or will you rather reaſon thus; Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> could be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit but on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtians Sabbath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the firſt day of the wéeke is the Sabbath of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians if this be your? argument, you doe but <hi>clauum clauo pellere,</hi> for when you ſhall haue prooued your ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12995:13"/>
by the word, then will I graunt the conſequent, and as eaſily may you prooue the one as the other: but let it be admitted, that you can prooue by ſcripture, that the Chriſtians were enioyned by the Apoſtles to aſſemble themſelues wéekely vpon the Sunday, to ioyne together in prayer, &amp; hearing the word preached: yet what word haue you to prooue, that<note n="g" place="margin">Neither doe we ſay, neither can you proue it is.</note> all bodily labour is vnlawfull vpon that day? they might well aſſemble in prayer vpon that day, and heare <hi>2.</hi> or <hi>3.</hi> ſermons, and yet ſpare ſome time to beſtowe vpon their labours, and the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement forbiddeth labor on the ſeuenth day, and not<note n="h" place="margin">The firſt day is now become the ſeuenth.</note> on the firſt day of the wéeke. Thus you may ſée (while you do <hi>nodum in ſcirpo quaerere,</hi> by ſéeking to prooue that by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Church doth hold by tradition) how you are driuen to wreſt the ſcripture, and how weake and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous your arguments be. If the obſeruation of the feaſt of Eaſter, and other feſtiuall dayes, prayer for the dead, or the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, had found the ſame entertainment with <hi>Iohn Caluine,</hi> as the obſeruation of the Sabbath hath done: I doubt not but that (although he would not haue allowed of traditions) yet hée would haue found you as ſufficient proofe for any of them out of the word, as hée hath done for the Sabbath: for ſo great a mote in your eyes is the tradition of the Church, that if your appetite ſerue to take liking of any point of doctrine grounded thereon, you will make any homely ſhift, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than you wil acknowledge the true<note n="i" place="margin">Tradition, a fountaine in Poperie.</note> fountaine, from whence it ſpringeth; and no maruell, for acknowledge the authoritie of thoſe traditions, which<note n="k" place="margin">If you may doe what you lift, we cannot ſtand.</note> by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of all antiquitie, were firſt deliuered by the Apoſtles, and haue euer ſince béen obſerued, and deliuered ouer as it were from hand to hand by ſucceſſion of Biſhops, and your hereſie wil fall to the ground. The next point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which you doe hold without warrant of ſcripture, is, that it is lawfull for Chriſtians to eat bloud, which was forbidden by the decrée of the firſt generall Councell where the Apoſtles were preſent:<note n="l" place="margin">I will finde you ſcripture for this in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles.</note> what ſcriptures haue

you to doe contrarie to a Canon of ſo great a councell? <hi>Pro. <hi>It is manifeſt, that in the infancy of the church, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hauing to do with the Iewes, a people wonderfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the ſtrict obſeruation of their law, did not thinke good to take from them all the ceremonies thereof at once: but rather by little and little to ſeeke to winne them by tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating many things for a time, which in the Goſpell were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; and to that intent</hi> Paul <hi>did circumciſe</hi> Timothy, Acts <hi>16. Pap.</hi>
                  </hi> What warrant of ſcripture haue you to prooue that the commandement was giuen to be obſerued but for a time, in regard of the weakneſſe of the Iewes? <hi>Pro. <hi>Wee haue the word to prooue that the ceremoniall lawes were aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, whereof ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayning from bloud is one: and it is euident by the 15. of the</hi> Acts, <hi>that the aſſembly of the Apoſtles in the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell at</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>was vpon this occaſion; they of the circumciſion which beleeued were greatly ſcandalized, becauſe the Gentiles, who were ioyned with them in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the ſame faith, had vtterly reiected their law, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon much controuerſie did ariſe between them; the Iewes contending that the beleeuing Gentiles ought to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and to obſerue the lawe of</hi> Moſes; <hi>and the Gentiles to the contrarie. For appeaſing whereof the ſayd Councell aſſembled, and decreed that the Chriſtians ſhould abſtaine from blood, by eating whereof (as it ſeemeth) the weake Iewes were greatly offended, intending thereby ſomewhat to ſatisfie the Iewes, and yet not to lay too heauie a yoke vpon the Gentiles. Thus you ſee how by the word the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bloud was prohibited vnto the Chriſtians of thoſe times, and how by the word it is permitted vnto vs. Pa.</hi>
                  </hi> By what word can you prooue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<note n="m" place="margin">This fellow loues to beare himſelf ſpeak elſe would he not make ſuch an idle repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> eating of bloud, which was both prohibited vnto the Iewes before the Goſpell, and to chriſtians in the Goſpell, is now lawfull for vs to doe? that the law preſcribed to the Iewes, concerning marriage within degrées of affinitie, is ſtill to be retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? and that the like law which commandeth the brother to raiſe vp ſéede vnto his brother deceaſed without iſſue,

                  <p>YOur Papiſt heere talkes in his ſleepe of two mortall wounds, which wee by our deſcription of the Church, haue giuen to our owne cauſe; and therefore your deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt bee had in memorie, which as it bindeth the true Church to the voice of Chriſt, ſounding in the canonicall Scriptures: ſo it giueth vs to vnderſtand that the falſe Church heareth the voice of ſtangers, and will not bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the written word of the Almightie; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the true Church may miſtake the voice of Chriſt, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12995:15"/>
ſo erre; whereby the firſt wound is fully healed: and if it ſhould be graunted, that the Church in generall cannot erre, yet it followeth not, that euerie one in particular that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hay or ſtubble vpon the foundation, is therefore no member of the Church: And ſo the ſecond wound, which ſpeakes of the excluſion of the Fathers &amp; Doctors, is neither mortall, nor ſenſible. Now touching the firſt wound, which cencerneth the Proteſtant and Puritane, it is here brought to certaine particular points, which I will ſpeake of in order: The firſt is, the obſeruation of the Sunday, which you proue ſyllogiſtically out of the Scripture, after this manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The day whereon the Apoſtles did ordaine, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould weekely meet together to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in hearing the word preached, receiuing the Sacraments, and giuing of Almes: that ſame day did the Apoſtles ordaine to be the Sabbath of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Apoſtles did ordaine, that Chriſtians ſhould weekely aſſemble themſelues vpon the firſt day of the weeke, for the purpoſe before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Apoſtles did ordaine the firſt day of the weeke to be the Chriſtians Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Now, where your Papiſt ſaith; <hi>That if the</hi> Maior <hi>were true, then the Apoſtles appointing moe dayes than one for ſuch exerciſes, ſhould appoint moe Sabbaths in a wéeke than one,</hi> his anſwere hath no colour or ſhewe of reaſon, for though euerie day in the weeke had beene ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: yet had they not beene all Sabbaths, vnleſſe they had weekely continued, as the firſt day did from weeke to weeke, till Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> baniſhment; at what time ſtill wee finde that day kept holy, and dedicated to the Lord, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the name, which the holy Ghoſt giueth it in the Reuelation.<note place="margin">Cap. 1.13.</note> Againe, where he ſaith: <hi>That the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſold their poſſeſſions, to the intent they might who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow themſelues vpon the ſeruice of God:</hi> It would be knowne by what tradition, or inſpiration he found that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12995:15"/>
out, ſeeing the ſcriptures informe vs,<note place="margin">Act. 2.45.</note> that their intent was to ſupply the neceſſitie of their poore brethren. I trow, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iewes that were to attend dayly vpon the morning and euening houres of praier and ſacrifice, did not vnload them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of their poſſeſſions: moreouer this lawe and ſale of poſſeſſions, though it were vſed at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet was it not in force in <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> and other Churches of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.2. Gal. 6, 6, &amp;c.</note> which had of their owne to put aſide and lay vp for the poore.</p>
                  <p>And touching the <hi>Minor,</hi> your Papiſt ſayth, that <hi>the Troiane Chriſtians were aſſembled the firſt day of the wéeke to breake bread,</hi> but not appointed ſo to doe by the preſcription of the Apoſtles; belike they came together by hap hazard, or by their owne appointment; howbeit, hee that planted the Church of <hi>Troas,</hi> cannot be ſo forgetfull, as to leaue euery man ſeparately to himſelfe, and not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point when they ſhould aſſemble themſelues, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall watring of that which was planted:<note place="margin">Act. 20.7.</note> now to note what time that was Saint <hi>Luke</hi> names, <hi>the firſt day of the weeke,</hi> otherwiſe there is no reaſon why it ſhould bee men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: moreouer whereas <hi>Paul,</hi> and his companie came to <hi>Troas</hi> the ſecond day of the weeke, and tarried there iuſt ſeuen dayes; yet no day of aſſembly is regiſtred but this one onely day; and yet we may not think that <hi>Paul,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie lay idle ſixe daies together, and forgat the worke of their calling: yea, but let vs admit, (ſaith your Papiſt) that <hi>Paul</hi> was to depart on the Tueſday, and that the Chriſtians were aſſembled on the Monday, &amp;c. Yea marry, then ſhould we be wiſe men, but the Diſciples of <hi>Troas</hi> met not to heare <hi>Paul</hi> preach, (for moſt of them had heard him preach before ſixs dayes together) but to breake bread, which they would haue done, though <hi>Paul</hi> had not beene amongſt them; and therefore this ſuppoſition is cloudie and riculous.</p>
                  <p>Touching the place to the Corinthians, your Papiſt ſaith that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not preſcribe the firſt day of the week for prayer, preaching, and adminiſtration of Sacraments: but for a laying aſide for the poore, according to euery
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12995:16"/>
mans deuotion, and I graunt all this to bee true: for thoſe holy exerciſes were inioyned the churches of Galatia and Achaia, when they were firſt planted, and ſo was the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for their owne poore: for this collection for the Saimes at Ieruſalem was extraordinarie: but that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would bee ſo troubleſome, as not to content himſelfe that this collection ſhould be made, as their other collections were, vpon their ordinarie meeting day, but to appoint another day weeke by weeke, to the hinderance of their ſeuerall callings, is vtterly incredible; nay ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I pray you, how your learned Papiſt doubleth the power of the argument which he goeth about to weaken: for when he asketh [why the Apoſtle inioyneth this collection to be made vpon that day,] and anſwereth himſelfe out of the text, [that there be no gatherings when I come,] and then asketh againe, [why the Apoſtle would haue no ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings when he came,] and anſwereth with a [no doubt] becauſe he would not haue ſuch ſpirituall exerciſes as hee determined to beſtow among them, hindered by ſuch col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections: what doth he elſe but confeſſe, that the firſt day of the weeke was the day, that <hi>Paul</hi> purpoſed to keepe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his comming, and therefore would not haue that day beſtowed vpon collections, when he came, but before his comming: otherwiſe if hee had meant to beſtow ſpirituall bleſſings ſo plentifully among them vpon any other day, then gatheringes made vpon that day, could not hinder him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but if theſe collections were hinderances to the ſpirituall exerciſes of the Sabbath, then it followeth, that the firſt day of the week, wherin <hi>Paul</hi> would haue theſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections made, was not appointed to be the Chriſtians Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Well wrangled: but howſoeuer this extraordinarie collection, inioyned by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> might hinder Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, that preached at <hi>Troas</hi> till midnight; nay, till the dawning of the next day,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.29.</note> and vſed to come with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the bleſſing of the Goſpell of Chriſt: yet their owne ordinarie miniſterie, being farre leſſe plentifull, could
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12995:16"/>
not be ſo eaſily hindered:<note place="margin">Apol. 2.</note> and therefore wee read in <hi>Iuſtine Martyr,</hi> that in his time, beſide preaching and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments, collections were made vpon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day in Chriſtian Churches.</p>
                  <p>One wrangle more remaineth againſt the force of this place to the Corinths; namely, that no generall aſſembly can be wrung out of it, becauſe the text ſaith, <hi>Let euerie one put apart by himſelfe, and lay vp,</hi> which argueth a priuat laying vp at home: for a man cannot be ſayd to lay vp that which he deliuereth to another. Well wrangled againe: but what? call you this a gathering? and is this kinde of laying vp at euerie mans owne home, a ſufficient diſpatch of all gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſo as there ſhould be no gathering at all, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould come himſelfe amongſt them? Wherefore little wringing will ſerue to prooue that this laying vp, is not meant of euerie mans owne purſe, or cupbord at home, which might be done any other day, as well as the firſt of the weeke; but of ſome publique Cheſt or Boxe, prouided for euerie mans free beneficence, as euerie particular man himſelfe found himſelfe able and willing.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the place of the Reuelation, where Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he was in the ſpirite on the Lords day,</hi> or,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.10. Pſa. 74.16.</note> as the Rhems Teſtament tranſlates it, <hi>the Dommicall day;</hi> Out of which we learne, firſt, that albeit all the dayes of the weeke are the Lords; yet this day is ſo called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as being a more excellent or eminent day, than the reſt, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a day conſecrated to the ſeruice of the Lord. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we learne that this day was famouſly knowne by the name of <hi>Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Dominicall day,</hi> in the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reuel. 1.4.</note> to whome Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> dedicated his Reuelation for it had been to no purpoſe for him to tell them, that <hi>hee was in the ſpirite on the Lords day,</hi> if they knew not what day that was, and how it was ſeuered by that name from the reſt of the weeke, and therefore as it was an eminent day, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from amonge the other dayes of the weeke for the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeruice of the Lord, ſo was it celebrated as an eminent day, and ſo ſtill kept in freſh memorie in the Churches of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12995:17"/>
                     <hi>Aſia:</hi> now that this day was the firſt day of the weeke, and no other, it will bee eaſie to ſhew without ſhifts, not onely becauſe no other day was euer permanently kept holy, but alſo becauſe we may trace the name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>Dominica,</hi> applied to this day, as it were a Hare in the ſnow, iſſuing out of this place of the Reuelation, into all the Churches of Chriſtendome. Yea, but (ſaith your Papiſt) <hi>Might not the firſt day of the wéeke be called</hi> the Lords day, <hi>in regard of Chriſts Reſurrection?</hi> I ſay no, for then it had been called the Riſing day, or, the Reſurrection day; as the like dayes be, namely, Aſcenſion, Circumciſion, &amp;c. For to call it, the Lords day, in regard of Chriſts Reſurrection, is vtterly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>When he demaundeth further; <hi>Whether the Iewes Sabbath might not remaine, or be aboliſhed, as other Ceremonies were,<note place="margin">Col. 2.16.16</note> without ſubſtituting another Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in place thereof?</hi> I anſwere, that the Iewes Sabbath is taken away by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo farre forth as it was ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, but the morall parts thereof, namely, that one day in a weeke ſhould be layd apart for ſpirituall meditations and exerciſes,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.12.</note> and for the recreation of ſeruants and dum crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was to be kept ſtill inuiolable without any ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as he dreames of: and ſo his other wranglements about bodily labour, and reſting the ſeuenth day, not the firſt day of the weeke are cleane daſht;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.5.11. Mark. 2.27. &amp; 3.4. Luk. 13.14. &amp;c. Ioh. 5.8. &amp;c. &amp; 9.6.7.14. Iren. lib. 4. ca. 19.</note> howbeit, that which was the firſt day of the weeke, is now become the ſeuenth day, and bodily labour was neuer altogether vnlawfull, no not in time of the lawe, as appeareth cleerely in many places of the new Teſtament. Now iudge you, or any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man elſe in the world, whether our arguments, or his anſweres be weake and ridiculous: as for his Tradition, the more he vrgeth it, the more hee confuteth himſelfe, and confirmeth our expoſition of theſe three places: for if the Apoſtles deliuered the obſeruation of the Sabbath by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wee may not thinke they deliuered it to ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and not to other ſome; and if they deliuered it to all without exception, then was it deliuered to them of <hi>Troas,</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:12995:17"/>
to the Galatians, Corinthians, and the Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> if to them, then can it not bee denied, but that theſe places of ſcripture, which I haue now diſputed of, doe cleerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the practiſe and continuall obſeruance of the Lords day, as it was deliuered to theſe Churches by the Apoſtles. I will not vouchſafe to anſwere your Papiſts vnpowdered talke of <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> that worthy ſeruant of God, and wire-whipper of popiſh marchants out of the houſe of God, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I will ſay, that if <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> were not a greater mote in his eie, then Popiſh traditions are in ours, he would haue ſpared this idle vagarie.</p>
                  <p>The next point is, eating blood,<note place="margin">Act. 15.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now followeth the third poynt, which hangs vpon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and not vpon Scripture,<note place="margin">Leui. 28. &amp; 20 Deut. 25.5.</note> namely the forbidding of marriage within degrees of affinitie; as if Leuiticus were no ſcripture; yea but, (may he ſay) Deuteronomy is ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too, as well as Leuiticus, yet the brother is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to raiſe vp ſeede to his brother, which in Leuiticus is made vnlawfull; now tell vs why you receiue the one and refuſe the other? here muſt you call for the helpe of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or els lie in the duſt? Alas, good Papiſt, you are much deceiued, for the law of Leuiticus is morall, and naturally ingraffed in the hearts of all nations, as appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the concluſion of this law in Leuiticus, from the foure and twentieth verſe to the end of the eighteenth Chapter: for if this Law had beene peculiar for the Iewes, there is no reaſon why the Canaaniticall nations ſhould bee puniſhed ſo ſeuerely, as there it is deſcribed, for the non obſeruance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12995:18"/>
of the ſame: as for the other law of Deuteronomy, it is an exception or diſpenſation in that particular caſe, for the common weale of the Iewes, wherein God had a ſpeciall care of the firſt borne and his inheritance: againe, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to nature, and to the explication thereof twice told in Leuiticus,<note place="margin">Cap. 18.16. &amp; cap. 20.21.</note> it might not continue longer vnrepealed.</p>
                  <p>Touching the example of the inceſtuous Corinthian which you propound; it will ſticke better to your Papiſts ribbes, then he is aware of: for how can that fornication be vnheard of among the Gentiles, which a man committeth with ſuch a one as hee may lawfully marrie? if then this Corinthian might lawfully marry his mother in law, verily ſingle copulation with her could not be ſo abominable, as that the very Gentiles could not abide it ſhould be once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amongſt them, and if ſingle copulation of the mother and ſonne in law was ſo much abhorred, then was it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull they ſhould marrie, and ſo the law of God in Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus is confirmed; and ſo indeed your Papiſt gently confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in theſe words [the law of the Corinths would permit no ſuch mariage, as may be gathered out of the text,] &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Now, touching the other hereſie of the Millenaries or Chiliaſts, your Papiſt tranſlateth [<hi>in prima reſurrectione,</hi> in the firſt reſurrection,] [at the reſurrection,] leauing out <hi>[prima,]</hi> as a note of ſhame; for if there be a firſt reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it followeth that there is another, call it a ſecond reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or what you will.

                     </note> that <hi>peccata maiora,</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinnes, be <hi>tunciam inſolubilia,</hi> be impardonable; and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith as much in his ſermons <hi>De Sanctis.</hi> Now then whereas the Pope thinkes, that our Sauiour in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> giueth vs to vnderſtand, that ſome ſinnes ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen in the world to come; let him tell vs what ſinnes thoſe be, great or ſmall; great ſinnes be <hi>tunc iam irremiſſibile,</hi> as he ſaith himſelfe: and if he meane ſmall ſinnes, then is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours ſpeech as farre out of ſquare, as if a man ſhould ſay, This great heape of corne cannot bee contained, neither in this buſhell, nor in a fleeting diſh.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould the ſpeech of Chriſt bee moſt fooliſh, if no ſinne at all be remitted in the world to come? might not our Sauiour ſpeake ſo by exaggeration, that the ſpeech might the better pierce the vncircumciſed hearts, and eares of the Phariſes?

example; when a partition is made, and nothing agreeth to one of the parts. Is this the folly hee talkes of? why it is eaſie to ſee, that not to remit the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, is anſwerable alike, both to this world, and the world to come, which bee the members of our Sauiours partition, for that great ſin is neuer remitted, neither in the one, nor the other;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.1. Galat. 1.8.

And in another place, <hi>though we or an Angell from heauen ſpeake otherwiſe, &amp;c.</hi> Yet Angels be no Preachers; ſo likewiſe the ſpirite of God ſaith, <hi>No man is able to open, read, or looke vpon the Booke, neither in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth:</hi> yet be there no openers, or readers, or lookers vpon Bookes in heauen, or hell.</p>
                  <p>Thus Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> is anſwered;<note place="margin">Cap. 12.32.</note> yet that you may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee how inſufficient this place of <hi>Mathew</hi> is to found Purgatorie vpon; I will ſet you downe diuers ſufficient and full anſweres which take away the force of all Popiſh col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. And firſt we may well aske what is meant by this world, and the world to come. For, albeit men commonly take this world, to be the ſpace intermedial between a mans birth and his death, which makes as many worlds, as there be men, or ſhall be, and euerie world to haue a ſeuerall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending, ſome paſt, ſome preſent, ſome to come: yet if I ſhould vnderſtand it otherwiſe, for the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this world,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.10.</note> till it bee diſſolued in the great day of God, and that ſame new heauen and newe earth bee made, whereof the world to come ſhall conſiſt; the caſe would be cleane altered, for then the Papiſts muſt not ſeeke for purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie in the world to come, as they did before, but in this world, where it is impoſſible to finde it, when the blind man in <hi>Iohns</hi> goſpel ſaith [ſince the world began,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.32.</note> was it not heard that any man opened the eies of one that was borne blinde.] I hope he means not, that ſuch a miracle was neuer wrought ſince the day of his birth, but from the creation.<note place="margin">Mark. 13.19. Math. 24.21.</note> For ſo Saint <hi>Marke</hi> expoundeth Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> where he ſayth, [there
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12995:51"/>
ſhall be great tribulation, ſuch as was not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world. Againe, when wee read elſewhere in <hi>Mathew,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 13.39.</note> that [the harueſt is the end of the world,] he doth not meane the day of euerie mans death, but the day of Chriſts ſecond comming,<note place="margin">1.

So then being armed with ſo many examples in this behalfe, and hauing Saint <hi>Marke</hi> to be our Captaine, and as it were fore-man in our queſt, we ſay, that not to bee forgiuen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, nor the world to come, is no more, but to be puniſhed and periſh both here and there, to be vnder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, to bee out of all hope of future deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhould wee labour to anſwere that, that needes no anſwere, for we confeſſe, there is a doing away of ſinnes in the world to come; and yet you are neuer the neerer your Purgatorie: for firſt, as [not to forgiue] is as much to ſay, as [to puniſh,] ſo [to forgiue] is as much to ſay, as [not to puniſh;] in which ſence, there is forgiuenes in the world to come, as well as in this world.

                  <p>But to leaue theſe faſhoods, and to giue you the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ancient Father, in a ſummary <hi>Compendium,</hi> wee muſt beleeue that bread in the Lords ſupper, is the bodie of Chriſt, not ſimply, but in ſuch a figure as taketh not away the truth of the Scripture, as we alſo beleeue man to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a true vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gent.</hi> 1.26, 27</note> the Image of God, for as man is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort the Image of God, as the word of God teſtifieth, though hee be not throughly ſo, neither in regard of bodie, nor ſoule, nor minde, nor baptiſme, nor vertuous liuing, not any other euident and liuely ſimilitude wee ſee him to haue with God, ſo doe wee beleeue that the bread which is of a round figure, and without ſenſe and feeling, is after a true manner and meaning the bodie of Chriſt, as the wordes of Chriſt teach vs, though it be not ſo by ſubſtance or apparant proportion and portraiture of bodily members. Wherefore though bread by nature be but a prophane common element appointed of God to feede our bodies: yet (by grace) it pleaſeth the Lord to make it, and to call it his bodie, that is a Sacrament of his bodie, whereby, as by an effectuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, the faithfull receiuers are ſpiritually fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be <hi>Epiphanius</hi> meaning, whereunto I will adde a few leſſons for more perſpicuitie, and for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwarting of thoſe two leſſons, which our Papiſt heere gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs. Frſt <hi>Epiphanius</hi> being learned and induſtrious, knew well inough wherein the Image of God conſiſted,<note place="margin">

Secondly, this Image is ſo defaced and ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in the poſteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi> that nothing in man or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12995:62"/>
man, ſeemeth anſwerable or agreeable vnto it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, notwithſtanding this obſcuritie, wee muſt beleeue the truth of Gods word, that man is created after the Image of God, and not ouerthrow that truth by allegoricall ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Fourthly, wee haue the like example in the wordes of Chriſt at his laſt ſupper; namely, this bread is my bodie, which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> knew to be ſpoken <hi>per gratiam,</hi> by grace; whereby that common element was aduanced ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and myſtically; yet truely to haue the name of the bodie of Chriſt, whereof it was a Sacrament. Fiftly, there is no apparant equalitie, or likelyhood, or outward ſenſible ſimilitude or proportion of members, why bread ſhould be ſo called. Laſtly, notwithſtanding this difficultie, we muſt beleeue that by bread, is meant true bread, and by bodie, the true bodie of Chriſt, and that the one is ſayd of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, figuratiuely indeed, becauſe they be <hi>diſpanita,</hi> yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our Sauiour ſpake, and not flye to origenicall allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which ouerthrowe the hyſtoricall truth of Gods holy word, and turne it into fables.</p>
                  <p>Theſe leſſons (I trow) be plaine inough, yet I doubt our Papiſt will not think his knot is yet looſed; there is nothing (ſaith hee) in the Sacrament that is incomprehenſible, but <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith not ſo, though he ſay it, neither can it bee inferred, out of <hi>quot ſunt &amp; ſimilia ſunt,</hi> for the Image of God was comprehenſible in <hi>Adam,</hi> though it be defaced in vs, and things may be, <hi>Similia ſecundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> but not to multiply quarrels, let vs graunt that he ſaith to bee true, what then?

I beſeech you what meanes this man by his It? is [It] ſomething, or is [It] nothing, or what is [It?] <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith, It, is of a round forme: therefore It, is not <hi>accidens,</hi> for <hi>rotundum</hi> is not <hi>accidens,</hi> but <hi>rotunditas;</hi> if It be a ſubſtance, then It muſt bee either
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12995:63"/>
the bodie of Chriſt, and ſo the bodie of Chriſt is of a round forme, or elſe it muſt bee bread, and ſo indeed all the three Euangeliſts are bold to call It,<note place="margin">

Now, for the vnlooſing of his knot, I ſay, that it is incomprehenſible, howe a round peece of bread ſhould bee ſuch a figure, as is worthy to bee called the bodie of Chriſt, and ſo to exhibite and conuey the graces and merites of Chriſts paſſion into vs, that our ſinnes are remitted, our faith encreaſed, and wee incorporate, and made members of his bodie, of his fleſh, and of his bones.

                  <p>To goe yet a little further, if it ſhould bee graunted him that this ſacrament is a ſacrifice abſolutely in it ſelfe, yet I hope it cannot releeue ſoules, nor doe any ſuch feat by it ſelfe, as it conſiſteth of dead elements, vnleſſe prayers and ſupplications, and giuing of thankes be annexed vnto it, for he that neither prayeth, nor giueth thankes, be hee prieſt, or king, <hi>Aaron</hi> or <hi>Melchiſedecke,</hi> cannot be ſaid to offer this ſacrifice: and relieue ſoules it cannot, vnleſſe it be offered.

Secondly, when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> ſaith, that the Martyrs are therefore remembred at the Altar, that they may ſo be mooued to pray for vs, he taketh the thankefull commemoration of their names at the Lords table without any further praying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Contr.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12995:74"/>
of the other, for when the one ſaith, <hi>Iniuria eſt pro Martyre orare, cuius nos debemus orationibus commendari,</hi> It is iniurie to pray for a Martyr, to whoſe prayers we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be commended. The other telleth you that the word <hi>magis,</hi> rather, is wanting, whereby wee are informed, that we ought rather to pray to Martyrs, than for Martyrs, and yet neither the one ſimply lawfull, nor the other.</p>

Secondly, they were conſtrained, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of hereſies, to handle ſuch high myſteries as were beyond their capacitie. Thirdly, in dealing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly againſt heretickes, they were ſometime, with feruor, carried into the contrarie extreame. Now will I ſhew you the difference beeweene theſe and the like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours eſcaped in the writings of the fathers, and thoſe points of doctrine wherein I haue cited them as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt you; the one they deliuer as their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate opinion, the other ſet downe as a doctrine<note n="x" place="margin">How knew they that, or you that they did ſo?</note> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiued, and practiſed through the vniuerſall Church, the one is (as the Prouerbe ſaith) but one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors opinion, the other an vniforme conſent of many; the one the Church hath reiected, the other it hath receiued and practiſeth.

Theſe few doctors whoſe bookes wee haue, were worthy men, yet one more worthy than
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12995:84"/>
another, and no one of them nor all of them together, to be preferred to thoſe that were before them. And heere let it be obſerued that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as he is a Montaniſt, is ſet down for one of of theſe admirable doctors of the Church, for he erred not in the caſe of ſecond marriages while he was a Catholicke doctor, but when he was an hereticke and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the Church; nay ſee further how intollerably hee defaceth the fathers, when he goeth about to magnifie, for if they looke vpon them to handle high myſteries beyond their capacitie, and were caried in heat againſt hereſie to the contrary extreame, verily their learning and piety may well be doubted of, and if they could not ſee the trueth vnleſſe it were called into queſtion, &amp; determined by the Church, there is no great reaſon why they ſhould be ſo highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and had in reuerence.</p>
                  <p>What man? why ſay you ſo? the doctors had their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and imperfections no otherwiſe then Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had, whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood to his face, and will you not admire and reuerence Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> Yes, ſir, that I will, for wee ſpeake not here of errors in liuing, which neuer any but Chriſt was free from, but errors in writing, whereof Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was neuer guiltie, and therefore bethinke you how, this ſuſpicious and irreuerend calling of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> credite into queſtion, to cloake the fathers errours withall, can be the part of a good Catholicke, we beleeue Saint <hi>Peter</hi> neuer erred in any thing he hath written, but you ſhal hardly driue vs with all your wharting; to beleeue the like of our new writers, or your old doctors, much leſſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of prophane Hiſtories, but why keepes this man all this doe, trow ye? would he haue vs pinne our religion vpon the ſleeues of the doctors, and ciuill Hiſtoriographers too? will nothing elſe pleaſe him? Yes, hee tels you he will be content if you will credit an vniforme conſent and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of diuers doctors, producing themſelues for eye witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and a thouſand other like witneſſes with them: well, when I heare thoſe thouſand other ſpeake, then he ſhall haue my anſwere, In the meane while haue we commended

to him, and tell him that I cannot beleeue a million of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, when they ſay nothing; and heere, I beſeech you, note how his wit ebbes, and his tongue flowes beyond the bankes of all poſſibilitie, they write ſaith he, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſacrificing for the dead, was vniuerſally obſerued in all Churches, they were preſent themſelues and hard and ſaw it done, and thouſands moe with them &amp;c. <hi>Quid audio?</hi> Did they heare and ſee it done in all Churches vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? this is no lie, my Lord, and thats all that I will ſay to it.</p>
                  <p>Now touching <hi>Auſtine,</hi> we ſo much the more admire him, in that he retracted his former errors, as many as hee could well-obſerue in his owne workes, neither doe wee doubt, but that he would haue retracted more if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued longer, &amp; could haue conſidered deliberately of all that hee had written, howbeit he wrote diuers bookes after his [retractations], neither could he ſo narrowly looke into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner of his workes, but that many things worthy to be [retracted], ſlipt through his fingers: to be ſhort, his [retractations] do euidently ſhew, that as he was a good and an honeſt minded man, ſo he altered in opinion as hee grew in yeeres, and was better inſtructed by long experience and trauell in diuinitie, and ſo conſequently, that he is ſo farre forth to bee receiued, as he buildeth vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the canonicall ſcripture, ſuch building will ſtand without [retracting], all other doctrine, as it begins in man, ſo man may end it, neither can it ſtand any longer than man liſteth to vphold it.</p>
                  <p>This wauering in the matter of Purgatorie, our Papiſt denieth impudently, &amp; cryeth in an agony, ſhew me where Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth deny purgatorie, as I haue ſhewed you he hath affirmed it? alas, he hath ſhewed <hi>Auſtines</hi> affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of the counterfeit ſermons and <hi>Homilies</hi> neuer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written or preached by Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> which is a moſt ſimple kind of ſhewing, but why doth he aske where <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> denieth purgatorie, and neuer asketh one word where he doubteth of it?

                  <p>One duſty reaſon yet remaineth, which our papiſt ſhakes out of the bottome of his bag, in theſe words, if there be no power in man to repent, or to doe good workes, why doth the Scripture exhort vs to repentance, newes of life, and good workes, and threaten to puniſh vs for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we cannot doe?<note place="margin">2.

               <p>AS touching this point of doctrine, the church of Rome doth teach none<note n="a" place="margin">But by your leaue, you are deceiued.</note> other thing, then that which our Sauiour Chriſt doth in the 16. of <hi>S Matthews</hi> Goſpell in plaine and expreſſe wordes, where hee ſaith vnto <hi>S.

Iohns</hi> Goſpell, where he ſaith to all his diſciples, Whoſoeuers ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted vnto them, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuers ſinnes ye retayne, they are retayned: ſo that you ſee the literall ſenſe is for vs, and the queſtion betweene vs, is of the right interpretation and true meaning of the wordes; you<note n="b" place="margin">VVe doe ſo, for the keyes of diſcipline are giuen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18.</note> do interpret the binding and looſing here mentioned, to be the preaching of the word of God, whereby ſinnes are forgiuen and looſed to the penitent hearers, and retained vnto the impenitent and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and we doe ſay, that by theſe wordes our Sauiour did giue authoritie and commiſſion vnto his diſciples and their ſucceſſors to forgiue ſinnes, not by their owne power and authoritie, but by the power and authoritie of him, whoſe commiſſioners they be, wherein wee doe attribute no more vnto the commiſſioners in the forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſinnes, than wee doe vnto a ſeruant that giueth poſſeſſion of his maſters land by vertue of a letter of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney, who although he haue himſelfe no intereſt in the land at all, yet hath he full power to conuey his maſters intereſt therein to<note n="c" place="margin">He knowes to whom, ſo doth not your popiſh prieſt.</note> whoſoeuer his pleaſure is to haue the ſame conueyed; it pleaſed God to make water an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the forgiuing of ſinnes in the Sacrament of Baptiſme: and in the<note n="d" place="margin">VVe know no ſuch ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this muſt goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other your forgeries.</note> ſacrament of penance, to make man an inſtrument, vnto whom wee doe attribute no more (as touching the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, in the one

                  <p>But goe too, let vs intreat the Cardinall to beare with his friend, and to procure him a diſpenſation to vnderſtand theſe two places, which he citeth, after his owne liking; what hath he than to ſay? Marry then I ſay, our ſenſe is more literall then yours, well, and what ſaith he elſe? Nay we ſay, that our Sauiour by theſe words, doth giue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and commiſſion to his diſciples and their ſucceſſors to forgiue ſinnes, not by their owne power and authoritie, but by the power and authoritie of him whoſe commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they be. Yea, but haue they commiſſion to forgiue ſinnes whereſoeuer they find it, or elſe in them onely that God is willing to forgiue? Their commiſſion I trow, is not vniuerſall to all without diſcretion, and to dreame who it is that God purpoſeth to ſhew mercy vnto, is beyond the capacitie of any man liuing, Papiſt to Proteſtant; he that hath a letter of Atturney from his maſter to giue poſſeſſion of, and knoweth the man to whom he is commaunded to conuey his maſters intereſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> but our maſter hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will hee hardeneth, neither may your popiſt Prieſt preſume that hee knoweth the mind of the Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.34.</note> and can find out his wayes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which be inſearchable, and ſo this ſilly papiſt heere confeſſeth, when he ſaith, that man giueth remiſſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended penitents, which God who ſeeth their hearts, doth not ratifie: now then conferre this power thus exerciſed hand ouer head to good and bad, as papiſts vſe it, with our preaching or publiſhing remiſſion to penitent ſinners, and then iudge whether is moſt like to be the better.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe he bragges of the literrall ſenſe, that it makes wholly for him, let him tell mee how the generall words of the Scripture, whatſoeuer thou ſhalt bind, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, whoſoeuers ſinnes yee remit, and whoſoeuers ſinnes ye retaine, can be literally reſtrained to ſuch onely as be truely penitent? if this cannot be done without a quatefication, let him not bragge that his ſenſe is

Alas good Papiſt, you cannot but know that our faith is no mans conceit or opinion, and it is a ſhame for you to confeſſe that you build your faith vpon the authoritie of the Fathers, or practiſe of the Church, be it neuer ſo ancient; I hope the fathers builded not vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers that were their ancients, but vpon the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble word of God, and what ſhould ayle vs, that we may not vſe that meanes the Fathers vſed before vs? you may talke long inough of Fathers and traditions, and your toppe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant [Church of Rome,] as though no one Father ſayd any thing for vs, yet when you haue all done, you muſt giue vs leaue, ot we will take leaue to found our faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vpon the written word of the Almightie.</p>
                  <p>Thus is your Popiſh fellowes Rhetoricke come to ſmall effect, and therefore he will now trie what his Logicke can doe. Thus I argue, ſaith he, to the vtter ouerthrow of your interpretation; how, I pray you? marry you ſhall heare, if Chriſt giue authoritie of building and looſing onely to his diſciples, and their ſucceſſors, then cannot preaching be that building and looſing, why ſo man? becauſe a learned lay man may bind and looſe in that ſenſe, as well as an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vnlearned miniſter, what is this I heare? may a lay man preach the word? or any ignorant and vnlearned miniſter either? we allow no ſuch blind preachers, as you doe Prieſts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 15. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5, 4.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth the laity from preaching when he ſaith, how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent? And againe, no man taketh honour vnto himſelfe, but he that is called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> but marke this arguing a little better, preaching forſooth cannot be binding and looſing, becauſe a learned lay man is able to preach, and may not a learned lay man bind and looſe too, as formally as your popiſh Prieſts? you will ſay no, becauſe he is not authoriſed ſo to doe by the Church, and I ſay againe, that he hath as good right to bind and looſe, as to preach the Goſpel, and therefore our papiſt muſt looke out ſome new premiſes, if euer hee looke to haue good of his concluſion.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer, whereas this fellow relies ſo much vpon anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, as if the ancient Fathers were fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, why doth not hee, or ſome of his idle companions take Maſter <hi>Foxes</hi> booke in hand, where the ſubſtance of all antiquitie is orderly ſet downe,<note place="margin">

thereon ſtubble and ſtraw, partly by ſome ſuperſtitious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions which themſelues conceiued of ſuch inuentions, and partly by the ſway &amp; violence of cuſtome, wherby they were caried to a liking of thoſe things, which they ſaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and practiſed by others, &amp; yet God forbid that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome errours which they held, wee ſhould raze their names out of the Kalender of Gods Saints, or thinke otherwiſe than reuerently of them. Againe, though they erred, yet were they notwithſtanding good men and holy Fathers; were not the Apoſtles holy men when they drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of an earthly Kingdome in this world? were they void of holyneſſe, when they beleeued that the Goſpell was to bee preached to the Iewes onely? Many holy Fathers were infected with the errour of the Chiliaſts, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are worthily accounted Saints of God; <hi>Cyprian</hi> and many godly Biſhops with him erred about the baptiſme mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by heretickes, yet loſt they not for all that the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and name of holy Fathers, &amp;c.

And againe, they erred not ſo wilfully as you, and therefore we account not of them as of you who haue multiplyed your errours, and left almoſt no one ground of pure religion vnſhaken.</p>

                  <p>Touching Puritanie, which ſtill this fellow quarrels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when hee can prooue it to bee either a Church, or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by it ſelfe, we will ſhape him an anſwere; in the meane time, let him know that no Proteſtant in England, or out of England, holds any doctrine neceſſarie to ſaluation, but ſuch as is warranted by Scripture, neither are we left wholly to our ſelues in matters of diſcipline, to appoint what wee thinke good,<note place="margin">

You Papiſts, though your brawles bee endleſſe one with another, Canoniſts againſt Schoole-men; Franciſcans againſt Dominicks; Nominals, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Reals; <hi>Thomas</hi> againſt <hi>Lombard; Scotus</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas; Occam</hi> againſt <hi>Scotus; Alliacenſis</hi> againſt <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam; Peter Sot</hi> againſt <hi>Catharine; Catharine</hi> againſt <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; Caietan</hi> againſt <hi>Pighius;</hi> Ieſuites againſt Prieſts; and Prieſts againſt Ieſuites: yet forſooth theſe dogs &amp; cats are of one Cage, they are all members of the Romiſh Church, but Proteſtants and Puritans being diuers names that differ not in the grounds of faith, but in ſmall points, as <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> doe in colour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and countenance, they forſooth cannot bee both members of the ſame Church.</p>
